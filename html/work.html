    <p><b>Junior Research Data Scientist</b>, <i>March 2024 - May 2025</i><br>
      <p style="display:block; width:100%; max-width:900px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.6;">As a Junior Research Data Scientist in the credit risk team, I contributed to credit-risk forecasting for a retail credit 
        portfolio. I participated in the development of an Early Warning System for delinquency detection, 
        working with a hybrid ARIMA + XGBoost approach that combines behavioral time-series dynamics with structural borrower 
        features. I also assisted in implementing online model-adaptation techniques that update risk signals between full retraining 
        cycles as borrower behavior evolves.

        Additionally, I contributed to ML-based data-drift monitoring by applying classifier-based drift-detection methods 
        to compare historical and incoming feature distributions. This helped the team detect shifts in 
        portfolio-risk patterns earlier and adjust decision strategies before deterioration became visible 
        in standard performance metrics.</p>

        <p style="display:block; width:100%; max-width:900px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.6;">
          During my Data Science internship at PwC in the Risk & Audit Analytics team, I worked on ML-driven anomaly 
          detection in financial statements and automation of audit analytics. I applied Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, 
          and robust statistical methods to detect unusual reporting patterns, sudden financial shifts, 
          and potential early fraud signals. I integrated these models into interactive dashboards and analytical workflows, 
          helping auditors quickly surface high-risk cases and reduce manual review effort.</p>

        <p><b>Machine Learning Engineer intern</b>, <i>May 2022 - September 2022</i><br>
          <p style="display:block; width:100%; max-width:900px; text-align:justify; line-height:1.6;">
            I completed a machine learning internship at the Ukrainian Bureau of Credit Histories, an organization closely
            integrated with the credit-risk and data-infrastructure ecosystem of PrivatBank — the largest bank in Ukraine.
            I contributed to building AI-ready data infrastructure by prototyping support for a new VECTOR data type in
            the credit-history database, enabling storage and retrieval of LLM embeddings for large-scale semantic search
            and advanced credit-data analysis. I also participated in developing a six-month credit-default prediction model
            for retail borrowers; the resulting model was incorporated into the bureau’s core credit-rating pipeline, 
            contributing to one of Ukraine’s principal national credit-scoring systems.
