    Abstract</button>

  <p class='abstract' id="abstract8">  The paper examines the construction and analysis of a new class of mixed exponential
    statistical structures that combine the properties of stochastic models and linear positive operators. The relevance of the topic is driven by the growing need to develop a unified theoretical
    framework capable of describing both continuous and discrete random structures that possess
    approximation properties. The aim of the study is to introduce and analyze a generalized family of mixed exponential statistical structures and their corresponding linear positive operators,
    which include known operators as particular cases. We define auxiliary statistical structures B
    and H through differential relations between their elements, and construct the main Phillipstype structure. Recurrent relations for the central moments are obtained, their properties are
    established, and the convergence and approximation accuracy of the constructed operators are
    investigated. The proposed approach allows mixed exponential structures to be viewed as a
    generalization of known statistical systems, providing a unified analytical and stochastic description. The results demonstrate that mixed exponential statistical structures can be used
    to develop new classes of positive operators with controllable preservation and approximation
    properties. The proposed methodology forms a basis for further research in constructing multidimensional statistical structures, analyzing operators in weighted spaces, and studying their
    asymptotic characteristics.</p>

      Abstract</button>
  
    <p class='abstract' id="abstract4">The article is devoted to the study of exponential statistical structures of type B, which constitute an important subclass of
      exponential families of probability distributions. This class is characterized by a number of analytical and probabilistic properties
      that make it a convenient tool for solving both theoretical and applied problems in mathematical statistics. The relevance of this
      research lies in the need to generalize known classes of distributions and to develop a unified framework for their analysis, which
      is essential for applications in stochastic modeling, machine learning, and financial mathematics.
      The paper proposes a formal definition of type B distributions based on the Laplace transform of dominating measures
      and a system of functional-differential equations describing their structure. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a statistical
      structure to belong to class B are established, and it is proved that such structures can be represented through a dominating
      measure with an explicit Laplace transform. The obtained results make it possible to describe a wide range of well-known
      one-dimensional and multivariate distributions, including the binomial, Poisson, normal, gamma, polynomial, and logarithmic
      distributions, as well as specific cases such as the Borel–Tanner and random walk distributions.
      Particular attention is given to the proof of structural theorems that determine the stability of class B under linear transformations and the addition of independent random vectors. It is shown that if a distribution belongs to class B, its linear
      transformations and sums also belong to this class with the corresponding parameters. Recursive relations for initial and central moments as well as for semi-invariants are obtained, providing an efficient analytical and computational framework for their
      evaluation.
      Furthermore, the “tails” of type B distributions are investigated using the properties of the Laplace transform. As a result,
      new exponential inequalities for estimating the probabilities of large deviations are derived, which extend classical approaches
      to the analysis of statistical distributions. The obtained results can be applied in theoretical studies and in practical problems of
      stochastic modeling.</p>

      This paper presents a study of power series distributions (PSD) with prescribed covariance characteristics. Such distributions constitute a fundamental class in probability theory and mathematical
      statistics, as they generalize a wide range of well-known discrete distributions and enable the description
      of various stochastic phenomena with a predetermined variance structure.
      The aim of the research is to develop analytical methods for constructing power series distributions
      with given covariances and to establish the conditions under which a particular function can serve as
      the covariance of a certain PSD. The paper derives a first-order differential equation for the generating
      function of the distribution, which determines the relationship between its parameters and the form of
      the covariance function. It is shown that the choice of an analytical or polynomial covariance completely
      specifies the structure of the corresponding generating function. Based on this, classes of distributions
      are established that realize linear, quadratic, and more general analytical dependencies between the expectation and the variance.
      The analysis made it possible to construct new families of PSDs that generalize the classical Bernoulli,
      Poisson, geometric, and other distributions while preserving a given covariance structure. The proposed
      approach is based on the analytical relationship between the generating function and the covariance
      function, providing a framework for constructing stochastic models with predefined dispersion properties.
      The results obtained expand the theoretical framework for describing discrete distributions and open
      up opportunities for practical applications in statistical estimation, modeling of complex systems,
      financial processes, machine learning where it is crucial to control the dependence between the mean and
      the variation. Further research may focus on constructing continuous analogues of such distributions,
      studying their limiting properties, and applying them to problems of regression and Bayesian analysis.

    Abstract</button>

  <p class="abstract" id="abstract3">
The article examines the distribution of the power series of the function $w(y) = (1 + \sqrt{1 - y})^{-1/2}$. The distribution of the considered function into a power series is obtained: $(1 + \sqrt{1-y})^{-1/2} = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(4m)!}{(2m)!(2m+1)! \, 2^{4m}} y^m$. The dispersion function is found $v(x) = x(2x+1)(4x+1)$, $x > 0$. A distribution with mean parameterization is constructed: $\Pr(\xi = k) = \frac{(4k+1)}{2^k}\binom{2k}{k}x^k (2k+1)^{k+\frac{1}{2}} (4k+1)^{-2k-\frac{3}{2}}, \quad x > 0$. It is proved that the raw moments $\alpha_m$, central moments $\mu_m$, cumulants $\chi_m$, $m = 1,2,\dots$, satisfy the recurrence relations: $\alpha_{m+1} = x\alpha_m + v(x) \frac{d\alpha_m}{dx}$, $\alpha_0 = 1$, $\alpha_1 = x$; $\mu_{m+1} = m\mu_m + v(x)\frac{d\mu_m}{dx}$, $\mu_0 = 1$, $\mu_1 = 0$; $\chi_{m+1} = v(x)\frac{d\chi_m}{dx}$, $\chi_1 = x$.
