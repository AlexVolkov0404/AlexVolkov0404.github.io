## About
Hi! My name is Oleksandr Volkov. I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in software engineering, statistics, and applied research. After graduating with honors in Software Engineering from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, I am now pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Statistics with a specialization in Machine Learning at the University of California, Berkeley. I am particularly interested in the intersection of applied statistics, machine learning, AI, and cloud technologies, and how these can be leveraged to solve complex economic and financial challenges. My goal is to combine rigorous quantitative methods with scalable engineering solutions to drive innovation and impact.
